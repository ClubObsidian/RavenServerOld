# Raven

Raven is the next generation of Obsidian Engine. While making Obsidian Engine I initially didn't have a direction for the project and the code was put into place as a proof of concept. Raven will take what Obsidian Engine did well and improve on it. Raven improves on Obsidian Engine by allowing for full modularity. Raven will allow developers to make modifications to the internals of Raven on runtime and while the server is running. The server will provide a default state but everything about the server can be changed on first boot to allow for full customization. Raven supports a wide variety of configuration files out of the box that includes: yaml, hcon, json and gson.

# Whats working?

Configuration files, nothing much else.

# Whats the point?

Raven is meant to be a blank slate to build off of. It provides a few building points to build applications off of but everything is meant to be configurable and as developer-friendly as possible.
